#
# This is the official list of people who have contributed
# to the Hypatia repository.
#
# The AUTHORS file lists the copyright holders; this file
# lists people.  For example, Oxide employees are listed here
# but not in AUTHORS, because Oxide holds the copyright to
# those authors' contributions.
#
# When adding J Random Contributor's name to this file,
# either J's name or J's organization's name should be
# added to the AUTHORS file, depending on whether the
# individual or organization owns the contribution.
#
# Names should be added to this file like so:
#
#     Individual's name <submission email address>
#     Individual's name <submission email address> <email2> <emailN>
#
# An entry with multiple email addresses specifies that the
# first address should be used in the submit logs and
# that the other addresses should be recognized as the
# same person when interacting on mailing lists or via tools.
#
# Please keep this list lexiographically sorted.
